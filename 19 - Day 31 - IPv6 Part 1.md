# Day 31 - IPv6 Part 1

Reviewed: No

### **1. Introduction to IPv6:**

- **Transition to IPv6:** IPv6 is the future of networking, replacing IPv4 due to the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses.
- **CCNA Exam Focus:** IPv6 is covered under topics 1.8 (configure and verify IPv6 addressing and prefixes) and 1.9 (compare IPv6 address types).
- **Why IPv6?** The primary reason for IPv6 adoption is the shortage of IPv4 addresses. IPv4 addresses are 32 bits long, offering around 4.3 billion addresses, which is insufficient for todayâ€™s global internet needs.

### **2. Understanding Numbering Systems:**

- **Binary (Base 2):** Uses two digits, 0 and 1. Indicated by prefix `0b`.
- **Decimal (Base 10):** Uses ten digits, 0 through 9. Indicated by prefix `0d`.
- **Hexadecimal (Base 16):** Uses sixteen digits, 0-9 and A-F. Indicated by prefix `0x`.

### **3. Hexadecimal Review:**

- **Conversion:** Each hexadecimal digit represents 4 binary bits.
- **Conversion Practice:Example Conversions:**
    - **Binary to Hexadecimal:** Split the binary number into groups of 4 bits and convert each group to its hexadecimal equivalent.
    - **Hexadecimal to Binary:** Convert each hexadecimal digit to its 4-bit binary equivalent.
    - Binary `1101 1011` = Hexadecimal `DB`.
    - Hexadecimal `2B` = Binary `0010 1011`.

### **4. Why IPv6 is Necessary:**

- **IPv4 Exhaustion:** IPv4 provides about 4.3 billion addresses, but the modern internet requires more due to the proliferation of devices.
- **IPv6 Solution:** IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses, allowing for approximately `340 undecillion` addresses (a vast number).

### **5. IPv6 Addressing:**

- **IPv6 Structure:**
    - **Length:** 128 bits.
    - **Representation:** Written as 32 hexadecimal digits, divided into 8 groups (quartets) separated by colons.
    - **Example:** `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`.
- **IPv6 Notation:**
    - **Prefix Length:** Uses a slash `/` to indicate the network portion (e.g., `/64` means the first 64 bits are the network part).
    - **Shortening Addresses:**
        - **Leading Zeros:** Can be omitted (e.g., `0db8` becomes `db8`).
        - **Double Colons (`::`):** Can replace consecutive quartets of zeros, but only once per address.
- **Practice Shortening:**
    - **Full Address:** `2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001`.
    - **Shortened:** `2001:db8::1`.

### **6. Expanding IPv6 Addresses:**

- **Reverse the Shortening:** When expanding an IPv6 address, replace the double colon with the appropriate number of `0000` quartets.
- **Example Expansion:**
    - **Shortened:** `2001:db8::1`.
    - **Expanded:** `2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001`.

### **7. Finding IPv6 Network Prefix:**

- **Prefix Identification:** Convert the host portion to zeros to find the network prefix.
- **Multiple of 4:** If the prefix length is a multiple of 4, conversion is straightforward by identifying the boundary between network and host portions.

### **8. IPv6 Configuration on Cisco Routers:**

- **Enabling IPv6 Routing:**
    - Command: `ipv6 unicast-routing` in global configuration mode.
- **Assigning IPv6 Addresses:**
    - Command: `ipv6 address [address]/[prefix length]` under the interface configuration.
    - Example: `ipv6 address 2001:db8:0:1::1/64`.
- **Verification:**
    - Command: `show ipv6 interface brief` displays the configured IPv6 addresses and their link-local addresses.

### **9. Link-Local Addresses:**

- **Automatically Assigned:** When an IPv6 address is configured on an interface, a link-local address is automatically assigned. Link-local addresses are used for communication on the same link and are not routable.
