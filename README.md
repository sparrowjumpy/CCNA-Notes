# CCNA Notes - Jeremy's IT Lab YouTube Series

## About

These notes are based on the [Jeremy's IT Lab CCNA series on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8W9oMNSuwo&list=PLxbwE86jKRgMpuZuLBivzlM8s2Dk5lXBQ&pp=iAQB). The series covers the topics required for the **Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA)** certification. The notes are structured in the same order as the video series and provide key points, commands, and explanations to help you study and revise.

## Notes Structure

The notes are organized by topics and days that correspond with the lessons from the YouTube series. Each file contains detailed notes and commands for the corresponding lesson, including practical examples and configurations.

I will be updating these notes regularly as I progress through the series and enhance the content.

## Updates

The notes will be updated as I study more and add further details. Keep an eye on this repository for more notes, updates, and additional learning materials!
